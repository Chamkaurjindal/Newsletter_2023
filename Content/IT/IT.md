The Department of Information Technology (DIT) imposes impact on both the urban and rural area students. It helps to create groomed, technically competent and skilled students, so that they can compete with the current computing industry. Our department also provides technical solutions for the problems related to the local society. Department provides ample opportunities and tools to the students for grooming them as a productive and participating global citizens. In the end, I can say we incorporate the good communication and technical skills as well as moral and ethical values for the overall development of the individual.

- **Satellite based navigation system: A journey from GPS to Mobile Phone Platform**  
 <p align=justify>
 Today large amount of geo-spatial data acquired from various sources and processed for various earth resources studies. These geo-spatial datasets for processing require secondary data in the form of geo-tagged samples, GCPs and ground based large scale maps. Now a days geotagged samples, GCPs and ground based large scale maps
 scenario GNSS have various measurement and positioning techniques which can be applied as per requirement in different applications. Apart from its applications in precise positioning GNSS has applications in various areas like TEC estimation & Earth quake studies, Atmospheric studies and Mobile GIS etc. The course was designed in such a way that first week lectures were dedicated to the basic information about
 the GNSS leading to studies carried out in  different areas in second week
